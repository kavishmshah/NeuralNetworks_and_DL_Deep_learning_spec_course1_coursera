# Neural_Networks_and_Deep_learning
Repo contains programming assignments from the course Neural networks and Deep learning, course1 from Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera(Deep Learning.AI).
  - Programming assignments in this course was aimed at binary classication with :
      - logistic regression (1-hidden layer)
      - 2-layer neural network.
      - L-layered neural network.
      
  - Three directories with assignments from each week.
  
  - Week 1&3 have two assigments each and both are present in distinct directories inside week1 and week3 directories respectively.
